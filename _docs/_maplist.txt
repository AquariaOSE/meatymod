intro warnings:
----------------

"First person who says touchscreen controls are better than a mouse gets shot in the face"
"For your safety, plug it in."
"A mouse isn't required, but neither is bathing. Think about it."
"Gamepad vs mouse vs touchscreen YOU BE THE JUDGE! (spoiler: mouse wins)"


how to start the mod? MUST BE WEIRD AND SICK AND TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE OF COURSE
----------------------

add some text like:

[black + fading text. maybe gameover-0004.png as bg?]
"longing for adventure..."
"nothing but an unfulfilled wish..."
"Painful years of waiting for a change..."	( <---- pun towards Alec!! )
[screen fade in, naija sleeping somewhere with a bottle in her hand. on land. rainbow soups nearby.]
"In the meantime, Naija found a different way of entertaining herself."
[colorful whirl fade in, change bg to gameover-0002.png]
"One day, after too much booze and rainbow soup..."
[wakes up slowly and looks around like whaaaaaaaat]
"she went on a trip she would never forget."
[sawblade pops out right in front of her. Ack!]
[more, on the whole map]
[Mia (ghost?) appears, warps away with her]   <--- this part needs improvement. not mad enough.
[start of mod. colorful whirl full on.]
[whirl goes away on level selection hub map]


FIXME: The stuff above needs more brain. Or probably less. But it could make sense of nonsense, at least.


Graphics possibly needed:
- make naija sprite/animation with a bottle in her hand (so only need a bottle)
- sunchair? Nah, not with the scene above. Seeing her in a sunchair and happily smashed isn't for the children.

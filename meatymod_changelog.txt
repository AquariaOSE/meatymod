2nd July 2012  - Fixed oversight that the time counter would not start if only arrow keys were used for movement

1st July 2012  - Added full gore mode: more & persistent blood & gibs (by request, not on by default. You asked for it!)
               - Made volcano area warp zone easier to see
               - Minor changes to some entities; nothing that would change gamplay

14th June 2012 - Fixed blue barriers in map energized

10th June 2012 - Forgot to add teleport return nodes to the last world (main_retribution map).
                 This caused always beginning at the entrance warp, instead of the warp
                 returned from. (For example when exiting from a level back to the map)

9th June 2012 - Fixed another bug that could cause saw shooters to stop shooting

25th May 2012 - Fixed problem on last level map ("Retibution") where Naija would not stay
                invincible after meeting Li, allowing to die and respawn, which would make
                the map impossible to finish.

24th May 2012 - Added a bunch of replacement graphics to get rid of desert/volcano overlays;
                for low-end PCs with low fillrate.
                Changed darkness in the volcano hub map so that it's not completely dark
                without the overlays.
              - Added one Q&A entry to the readme

              - Fixed possible crash on map reset
              - Forgot to close an unconnected map link in one of the outtro maps

20th May 2012 - Fixed bug that invisible warp zone warps could be clicked on (thx Daxar)
              - Changed wording in one of the outtro scenes slightly (thx FrancesF)

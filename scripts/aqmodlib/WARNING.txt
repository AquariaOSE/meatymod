This is my own Aquaria modding support library.
The _loader.lua file in the parent directory belongs to it as well.

The parts that are used for this mod work, the rest
is pretty much WIP and possibly unstable/unoptimized/slow/wrong.

Just in case you plan to use this for anything, better send a mail
to false.genesis@googlemail.com and I'll send you some up to date version
instead of this cruft.

Also note it requires my own 1.1.3+ branch:

Have fun, yo!
